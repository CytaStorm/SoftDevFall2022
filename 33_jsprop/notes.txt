QCC:
Q: It seems like the order matters for the loops, but adding eventlistner by itself ignores order??
Comment: Boolean gives popup priority
Comment: stoppropagation interrupts something in the javascript: current theory: 
        1.javascript reads the eventlisteners in order of appearance in code
        2.js rearranges popups based on DOM and boolean args

        stoppropagation interrupts right after step 1, makes any boolean args/dom priority not affect the popups
