Predictions:
What are request.args and request.headers?

We think disp_loginpage displays basic info about the form.
It seems that authenticate uses request to process user input?

authentiate and disp_loginpage seem to be the same?

Reconciliation:
When we first spin up the site and go to 127.0.0.1:5000, it runs the disp_login, which displays the html template.

The html has <form action="/auth">, which tells the site to put /auth in the address bar, alongside the values that we put into the form.
In app.py, /auth runs the authenticate method, which displays "Waaaa hooo HAAAH"

request.args is an immutableMultiDict that stores the stuff from login.html's output:
      <input type="text" name="username">
      <input type="submit" name="sub1">
as 
ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'poop'), ('sub1', 'Submit Query')])
